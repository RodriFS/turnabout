# Turnabout
A general purpose, dynamically typed (so far), interpreted (so far) programming language.

### Motivation
This is a learning project, the goal is not to have a fully fledge and useful language, but to tip my toes into the
vast and awesome world of making a language and its features.

### Goals
The goals of this project is to have a language that is:
- Statically typed
- Compiled
- Garbage collected

While this is the main goal, and since I have a lot to learn yet, the language is so far dynamically typed, and interpreted.
